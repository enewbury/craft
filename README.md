# Craft

todo:
- multi-raft
- cluster splitting
- smart appendentries intervals for commands (immediate, interval-based batching...)
- speculative batch-writing for speed? (take snapshot, commit speculative, continue or revert to snapshot)
- broadcast replication lag to clients, to allow them to target non-linearizable reads to specific followers
- be consistent with "members" vs "nodes" nomenclature
- adaptive heartbeat intervals
- 4.2.1 server catch up "rounds" hueristic
- flow control (max bytes per message, sliding window, etc)
- don't deserialize entries when fetching from persistence for transmission to followers (also lets us know how big a message is going to be, for congestion control)

features:
- leader leases for fast linearizable reads (pluggable time-source support, batteries included with clockbound)
- linearizability checker with fault injector + visualizer
- cluster visualizer
- 3.10 leadership transfer extension
- PreVote
- CheckQuorum
- rocksdb backend
- fast snapshot transfer via sendfile sysctl
- linearizable follower reads via read-index
- write-optimized mode
